***Milestone #4***
									
At this point, we have uploaded all relevant soccer data to our database instance on AWS RDS (see
accompanying ER diagram for schema).

We have built a web app with the basic functionality we had aimed for at the beginning of this 
project, and submitted in milestone #2. Some of those features include:

	1) 	An accessible web app with some pre-set queries users may select to see results. These
		queries access our database in real-time (the output is not pre-loaded).
	
	2) 	The basic, pre-loaded queries make extensive use of aggregate and sorting commands which 
		often scan multiple relations in a single query.
		
	3) 	The queries scan most of the relations in our database and often use JOIN or other 
		multi-relation commands in processing.
		
	4) 	The web app is aesthetic to use, and output is displayed in an orderly and readable fashion.
	
Between our basic features demo and our final project submission, we plan on implementing additional
features including:

	5)	Structured queries which incorporate user input before being processed; for example, users
		may look up a performance metric for a specific country or the winner of a particular
		tournament in a particular year. 
		
	6)	Structured query functionality will be implemented to accept free user input (strings) OR 
		as a drop-down menu.
